# ShowAllInspections
Script written during my first co op. Returns a table of all inspection info based on information entered by the user.
User enters what day they want to pull and which type of inspections they want.
Inspections.php uses that info to do a GET request from the API. The info is then returned to the user in table. There is a lot of information in this table so I tried to use formating to make it a little bit more readable.
